        <h3>Path to becoming a software developer</h3>
        <div>
          I initially became interested in software development during my high
          school years, a time when my passion for video games ran deep. While
          the precise catalyst eludes my memory, I distinctly recall nurturing a
          dream of crafting my own games. This aspiration propelled me into a
          journey of learning to program with Unity and UnityScript over the
          following years.
        </div>
        <div style={{ marginTop: '10px' }}>
          After finishing school I ended up in the Australian Army for slightly
          over 4 years. Through the training and challenges of military life, I
          have cultivated a strong love for self-discipline and fostered the
          adoption of a stoic mindset. This foundation of my character has
          equipt me with the tools to persevere, adapt and maintain resilience
          when confronted with adversity.
        </div>
        <div style={{ marginTop: '10px' }}>
          While I cherished the challenges and the lifestyle inherent in the
          defense force, I found that the tasks often grew monotonous and failed
          to offer the mental stimulation and growth I yearned for. Throughout
          this time, a persistent desire burned within me to engage in something
          more intellectually demanding. Empowered by this newfound knowledge, I
          recognized the imperative for a career shift.

        <div style={{ marginTop: '10px' }}>
          Each year, a three-month-long field exercise took place, granting
          ample downtime for someone in my role. Faced with limited
          distractions, I seized this opportunity to immerse myself in reading,
          devouring a multitude of books throughout each period. It was during
          the 2016 iteration of this exercise that I delved into "Elon Musk: How
          the Billionaire CEO of SpaceX and Tesla is Shaping our Future". The
          technical mindset depicted in the book resonated deeply with me,
          evoking memories of my past endeavors in game programming. This marked
          the inception of a transformative journey, igniting my determination
          to transition my once-cherished hobby into a fulfilling career path.

        <div style={{ marginTop: '10px' }}>
          Later that year, after the completion of the army Junior Leadership
          Training course, I enrolled in a Diploma of Software development with
          the online training platform Upskilled. In the years that followed, I
          dedicated myself to the completion of my studies while simultaneously
          embarking on the creation of multiple projects learning to create
          desktop applications with Dotnet WPF, web Api's with Dotnet Web Api
          and web applications with Angular and React.
